From spin classes to online platforms like <a href=\"/tags/zwift\">Zwift</a>, the past couple of years have seen many of us spending more time pedalling in one place. By consequence, then, this means new things to buy!</p>\n<p>So while indoor cycling doesn’t really require more than a set of bibshorts to cushion your soft bits and a pair of cycling shoes to clip into the pedals, it’s now possible to purchase clothing and footwear designed never to be sullied by the splash of a puddle or brushed by the passing of a spring breeze.</p>\n<p>Mild cynicism aside, indoor cycling is invariably a sweaty affair, so having a separate set of lightweight kit will help you stay more comfortable. And while your regular summer kit will transfer indoors with little issue, there’s no reason not to treat yourself to something more specific.</p>\n<p>Some of it will even work outdoors too...</p>\n<h2>Indoor cycling clothing: what to wear on the turbo</h2>\n<h3>Castelli</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42388\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/castelli_insider.jpg?itok=JqGal23O\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Castelli Insider Jersey</h3>\n<p><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Short-Sleeve-Jersey_214307.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz</a> for <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Short-Sleeve-Jersey_214307.htm\">£75</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"file-42387\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/castelli_insider_jersey_0.jpg?itok=LAnWViuk\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Billed as the lightest jersey Castelli has ever made, the Insider top uses incredibly light 3D mesh fabric to allow for maximum airflow. Certainly, it’s see-through enough you’d have to be quite brave to wear it outdoors.</p>\n<p>Cut with a low collar and high front, there’s as little of it as possible, with the racy trim of the jersey being suited to aggressive training rather than upright gym-style spinning.</p>\n<p>At the same time, its skintight shape and typically tight Castelli sizing mean this is probably best suited to slimmer users. With two easily accessible rear pockets, these have also been adapted specifically for use indoors.</p>\n<p>Marketed as equally usable outdoors, it’ll serve in the hottest conditions, assuming you’re not too bashful about revealing what’s underneath.</p>\n<p><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Short-Sleeve-Jersey_214307.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz</a> for <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Short-Sleeve-Jersey_214307.htm\">£75</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Castelli Insider Bibshort</h3>\n<p><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Bib-Shorts_214308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz</a> for <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Bib-Shorts_214308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">£110</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"file-42386\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/castelli_insider_bib_short.jpg?itok=5RNiqck1\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This is Castelli’s road-going knowhow transferred to the indoor arena. With a range of established fabrics and pads, the Italian brand has picked the lightest and most airy bits and assembled them into the Insider bibshort.</p>\n<p>Going in a different direction from the other brands shown here, Castelli reckons an indoor-specific bibshort actually wants a lighter pad. To this end, the Insider short borrows the brand’s well-known Kiss Air2 pad which is fairly thin in the interests of breathability.</p>\n<p>For the fabric, Castelli employs its Inferno summer-weight material, while raw cuts to the cuffs aim to ease any restriction, a feature expanded upon by the soft Doppio waistband.</p>\n<p>With no real reason not to wear them outside too, you even get a pro pocket for stashing your race radio – or more likely a phone for accessing your playlist. Perhaps surprisingly for Castelli, all this translates into one of the brand's cheapest shorts, which makes it hard for them to appear as anything other than good value.</p>\n<p><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Bib-Shorts_214308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz</a> for <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Castelli-Insider-Bib-Shorts_214308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">£110</a></strong></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Le Col</span></h3>\n<div id=\"file-42391\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/le_col_x_wahoo_indoors.jpg?itok=xy9m2g5f\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Le Col x Wahoo Indoor Training Jersey</h3>\n<p><strong>Buy <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-jersey?variant=31946875142207\" target=\"_blank\">men's</a> or <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/womens-le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-jersey?variant=31950887387199\" target=\"_blank\">women's</a> now from <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-bib-shorts-collective-edition\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col</a> for <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-bib-shorts-collective-edition\" target=\"_blank\">£150</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"file-42384\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/le_col_x_wahoo_indoor_training_jersey.jpg?itok=Fh-HnnyT\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Employing a race-style cut, this smart-looking mesh-like jersey aims for maximum breathability.

From fast-wicking straps to laser cut incisions down its somewhat revealing side panels, it aims to be as barely-there as possible.</p>\n<p>Nicking features from Le Col’s WorldTour-tested lightweight Summer Pro Bib Shorts, the adapted Dolomiti Pro Gel chamois features increased padding to compensate for the lack of movement found when riding indoors. Preventing the saddle causing undue pressure on soft parts, thankfully it’s matched by more opaque fabric across the front and back.</p>\n<p>Properly premium in price, it’s up to you if you want to spend so much on something that might not ever see the sun. Also, having to wash at 30°C is a bit of a drag for something that’ll get very sweaty and require regular laundering. </p>\n<p><strong>Buy <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-bib-shorts-collective-edition\" target=\"_blank\">men's</a> or <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/womens-le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-bib-shorts-collective-edition?variant=33275019231295\" target=\"_blank\">women's</a> now from <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-bib-shorts-collective-edition\" target=\"_blank\">Le Col</a> for <a href=\"https://lecol.cc/collections/le-col-x-wahoo/products/le-col-x-wahoo-indoor-training-bib-shorts-collective-edition\" target=\"_blank\">£150</a></strong></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Madison </span></h3>\n<div id=\"file-36210\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2020/03/madison_turbo_bib_short_.jpg?itok=jifB8IfV\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<h3>Madison Turbo Jersey</h3>\n<p><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.freewheel.co.uk/madison-turbo-men-s-short-sleeve-jersey-varcl120\" target=\"_blank\">Freewheel for £55</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"file-42392\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/madison_turbo_jersey.jpg?itok=_xjL4COk\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Available in loud or muted colourways, this mesh-type jersey does a good job of endearing itself to the indoor cyclist. For one it’s low in overall weight and doesn’t cost too much.</p>\n<p>Taking its indoor billing seriously, it does away with any pockets, potentially resulting in a marginally less sweaty back. With very little in the way of cuffs or collar, these areas too should be nicely unrestricted.</p>\n<p>Yet perhaps even smarter than either of these features is the fact you can chuck it in a 60°C wash.
