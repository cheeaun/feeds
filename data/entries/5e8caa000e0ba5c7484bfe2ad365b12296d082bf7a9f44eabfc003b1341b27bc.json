Rounding off UAE Team Emirates's leadership at the Tour will be Alexander Kristoff, four-time stage winner and wearer of the first yellow jersey at last year's race.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best bicycle mudguards for winter 2021: protect your bike </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/2079/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best cycling gloves for winter 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/7925/turbo-training-accessories-everything-you-need-for-training-indoors\">Turbo training accessories: Everything you need for training indoors</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nPogacar will see his friendly yet fascinating rivalry with Slovenian compatriot Roglic resume as it was reported that the current Vuelta champion would be returning for revenge at this year's Tour as part of his team's leadership trio.</p>\n<p>According to Dutch website <a href=\"https://www.wielerflits.nl/nieuws/jumbo-visma-opnieuw-met-roglic-dumoulin-en-kruijswijk-naar-de-tour/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wielerflits</em></a>, Jumbo-Visma has decided upon its Tour team already, looking to aim at yellow jersey success with Dumoulin and Kruijswijk alongside Roglic.Â </p>\n<p><em>Wielerflits</em> went further in stating that the rest of the team would include Sepp Kuss, <a href=\"/tags/wout-van-aert\">Wout van Aert</a>, Tony Martin, Robert Gesink and Mike Teunissen.</p>\n<p>The Dutch team had initially planned on taking the same trio of leaders to last year's Tour, however Kruijswijk was forced to miss the race after crashing at the Criterium du Dauphine just weeks before the Grand Depart.</p>\n<p>Eventually, Jumbo-Visma was left with just one leader at the Tour in Roglic as Dumoulin battled severe saddle sores throughout the race, but worked for his teammate throughout.</p>\n<p>This solo leadership almost paid off with Roglic wearing the yellow jersey into the penultimate day's <a href=\"/tags/time-trial\">time-trial</a> on La Planche des Belle Filles but, now famously, we all know that he fell just short of the overall victory, being <a href=\"/in-depth/8831/tadej-pogacar-the-man-who-would-be-king\">beaten by Pogacar in one of the most impressive individual performance in decades</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond the reignition of a Pog-Rog battle at the Tour in July, it is looking likely that 2018 champion <a href=\"/tags/geraint-thomas\">Geraint Thomas</a> will return as one of the <a href=\"/tags/team-ineos\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> team leaders. Meanwhile, question marks hang over 2019 winner and teammate Egan Bernal with reports suggesting the Colombian may target the <a href=\"/tags/giro-ditalia\">Giro d'Italia</a> in May.</p>\n<p>Other General Classification riders confirmed for the Tour de France so far include <a href=\"/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a>'s Julian Alaphilippe, Israel Start-Up Nation's <a href=\"/tags/chris-froome\">Chris Froome</a>, Mikel Landa and Pello Bilbao of Bahrain Victorious and <a href=\"/tags/trek-segafredo\">Trek-Segafredo</a> duo Vincenzo Nibali and Bauke Mollema. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"5e8caa000e0ba5c7484bfe2ad365b12296d082bf7a9f44eabfc003b1341b27bc","category":"Cycling"}
