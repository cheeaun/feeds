Don&#8217;t worry! The Mid South isn&#8217;t asking you to come to Stillwater, Oklahoma during a pandemic. We all know that <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2020/06/bike-racing-white-privilege-and-the-corona-virus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bike racing during a pandemic is problematic</a>. No, instead Bobby and the team at District Bicycles would like you to partake in a socially distanced event with a twist&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want you to go ride or run (or both!) outside, just like you had planned, but you don’t have to pack up and travel to Stillwater. We are partnering with several bicycle shops in cities and states where many of you live. We are working with each shop to create comparable 100-mile, 50-mile and 50K routes in that area.  Ride With GPS will facilitate a challenge board, which any registered rider or runner can join. We will share the links for each challenge (100, 50, 50K) in March.  If you’re registered for The Mid South and have at least a free account with Ride With GPS, you’re good to go. <em>You must have an account with Ride With GPS to participate in the challenges.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://www.midsouthgravel.com/notvirtual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Mid South</a>!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ba1c6fd198632c92635620942d84eb6e67b5d46236ed2f1fc402e054fd7ab01d","category":"Cycling"}
