{"title":"Apple Exec Shuffle: Dan Riccio Takes Secret Position; John Ternus Now SVP of Hardware","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/dan-riccio-begins-a-new-chapter-at-apple/","date":1611615091000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today announced Dan Riccio will transition to a new role\nfocusing on a new project and reporting to CEO Tim Cook, building\non more than two decades of innovation, service, and leadership at\nApple. John Ternus will now lead Apple’s Hardware Engineering\norganization as a member of the executive team.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My quick take, after asking around a bit: This is nothing but good news for Apple. Riccio and Ternus are both all-star A-Teamers — very smart, very effective, and well-respected and liked. This is <em>not</em> an easing-out-the-door of Riccio: he really is taking over something big and new. And Ternus is incredibly well-suited to take over as SVP of hardware for all existing product lines.</p>\n\n<p>I still don’t know which project Riccio is heading, but my guess is that it’s the headset, not Titan, simply because I’m certain the headset is closer. I think it’s a sign that the headset is ready to get real, and Apple wants someone as capable as Riccio to lead it with nothing else on his plate.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Apple Exec Shuffle: Dan Riccio Takes Secret Position; John Ternus Now SVP of Hardware’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/25/riccio-ternus\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"cfe0bd543a8c0ecbf2ebdc5dd46a81d8e80530a208cdb24680055cf11874c78b","category":"Tech"}
