First, on the truth:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote\nthat a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of\ntheir love. What are the common objects we love that define us as\nAmericans? I think I know. Opportunity. Security. Liberty.\nDignity. Respect. Honor. And, yes, the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is\ntruth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit. And\neach of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as\nAmericans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to\nhonor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth\nand defeat the lies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Second, on change:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here we stand looking out in the great mall where Dr. King\nspoke of his dream. Here we stand, where 108 years ago, at\nanother inaugural, thousands of protesters tried to block brave\nwomen marching for the right to vote. And today we marked the\nswearing in of the first woman in American history elected to\nnational office: Vice President Kamala Harris. Don’t tell me\nthings can’t change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Joe Biden’s Inaugural Address’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/21/bidens-inaugural-address\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ad1402711eeff70c3662134d41ded60d62b34a511989331c8286bfaa39525b5a","category":"Tech"}
