If the best athletes in the world can't get there it starts to invalidate the legitimacy of the medals that are being dished out.'</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best bicycle mudguards for winter 2021: protect your bike </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/2079/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best cycling gloves for winter 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/7925/turbo-training-accessories-everything-you-need-for-training-indoors\">Turbo training accessories: Everything you need for training indoors</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAlthough sporting events have been pulled off successfully since the pandemic began, the size of the Olympics makes it a bigger risk and measures like the NBA's Disneyland bubble, tennis players' quarantining in hotel rooms prior to the upcoming Australian Open and the rigorous testing to get all three Grand Tours on, would be incredibly difficult with the number of people involved.</p>\n<p>To add to that, the suggestion by International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound to give athletes priority access to the vaccine <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/9086/comment-the-priority-vaccination-of-uae-team-emirates-riders-has-left-me-feeling\" target=\"_blank\">presents a moral dilemma</a> if those most at risk have not yet had it. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"0aa712c9e35a54839b62b9a3fd6781b5272ffb1016fad7dfa600f0927b3a9ee5","category":"Cycling"}
