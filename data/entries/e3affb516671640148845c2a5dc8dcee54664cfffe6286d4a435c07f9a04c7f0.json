These apps were not able to filter or inspect traffic for some built-in Apple apps. That functionality has been removed in &zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.2.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nWhen &zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.2 sees a release, Apple apps will be compatible with VPN apps and will no longer be able to bypass firewalls and other security tools. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nAccording to Apple's release notes, the update also improves Bluetooth reliability and includes multiple bug fixes. <blockquote>&zwnj;macOS Big Sur&zwnj; 11.2 improves Bluetooth reliability and fixes the following issues:\r\n<br/>\r\n- External displays may show a black screen when connected to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> (<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, 2020) using an HDMI to DVI converter\r\n<br/>\r\n- Edits to Apple ProRAW photos in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app may not save\r\n<br/>\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/\">iCloud Drive</a> could turn off after disabling the &zwnj;iCloud Drive&zwnj; Desktop & Documents Folders option\r\n<br/>\r\n- System Preferences may not unlock when entering your administrator password\r\n<br/>\r\n- Globe key may not display the Emoji & Symbols pane when pressed</blockquote>The update addresses a bug that could cause external displays to show a black screen when connected to an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; using an HDMI to DVI converter, and it fixes an issue that resulted in edits to Apple ProRaw photos in the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app not to save.
