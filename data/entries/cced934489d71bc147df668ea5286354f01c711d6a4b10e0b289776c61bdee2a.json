Like Rouleur, there will be eight issues a year, but each issue will be printed and shipped directly from Italy and Spain. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/suscribete-a-volata\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Screen_Shot_2020-12-22_at_17.25.22_1024x1024.png?v=1608658082\" alt=\"Volata issue 24\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/suscribete-a-volata\" title=\"Suscríbete a Volata\"><strong><em>Suscríbete a Volata y recibirás el último número publicado</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>With two new editions, we also welcome two new editors, Emilio Previtali and Olga Àbalos, who are introduced below.

My first encounter with Rouleur was a shock. They spoke of cycling in a way that was close to how I see sport; writing not only about results and competitions, but the human stories behind them, the results, failures, and experiences. Standing at the newsstand with Rouleur in my hands, the desire to create my own cycling magazine was born. Soon after, that desire became a reality, and then, after a few years, here I am at Rouleur, publishing the very first Italian edition. It feels like the closure of a circle, the fulfilment of a dream. Now, I look forward to an exciting future and can’t wait to bring my passion for cycling and stories to you.</span></p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/abbonati\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe to Rouleur Italia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span><strong><em>Subscribe to Rouleur Italia</em></strong></span></a></p>\n<p><span>Follow Rouleur Italia on: </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rouleurmagazine_it/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rouleur Italia Instagram\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span>Instagram</span></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rouleur.magazine.italia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Rouleur Italia Facebook\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span>Facebook</span></a></p>\n<h4>\n<span>VOLATA - </span>OLGA ÀBALOS</h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/OL_480x480.png?v=1608656549\" alt=\"Olga\"></p>\n<p>I discovered Rouleur ten years ago and that made a great impact on me. It made me wonder if a magazine like this could be done in Spanish. Four years later I decided to bring together a small group of cycling enthusiasts and launch Volata Magazine, to develop the kind of sport journalism we wanted to do. We really believe sport is a cultural and social expression and cycling is a way of life that should be communicated with high standard contents, photography, and design. So joining Rouleur is quite a natural process for us; we really think our journey together will help us to offer our existing and new readers a broader and more engaging range of cycling content.</p>\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/suscribete-a-volata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Subscribe to Volata\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span mce-data-marked=\"1\"><strong><em>Subscribe to Volata</em></strong></span></a></p>\n<p>Follow Volata on:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ccvolata/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Volata Instagram\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/volata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook Volata\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a></p>\n    ","author":"Miles Baker-Clarke","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"cced934489d71bc147df668ea5286354f01c711d6a4b10e0b289776c61bdee2a","category":"Cycling"}
