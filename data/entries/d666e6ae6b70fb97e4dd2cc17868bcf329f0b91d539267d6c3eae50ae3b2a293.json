We dropped the bikes at our campsite and headed to the beach for a mandatory swim and some spear-fishing.

The San Pedro ferry didn’t leave the island until 5 pm, so we had the afternoon to burn meandering around the northern area of Catalina, which arguably holds the best sections of gravel on the entire island. After fueling up on burgers and Buffalo Milk (it’s not what you think) we pushed up to Parson’s Landing for a quick spot-check and then raced the clock back to the ferry dock. With a few pocket beers from the General Store, we boarded the ferry and settled in for the ride back to the mainland &#8211; with the island silhouetted against a tangerine sky as it faded into the distance.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204817\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/DSC00494.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Back on the mainland, the final stretch through industrial Long Beach back to our vehicles was a striking reunion with the real world that we had left behind 36 hours prior &#8211; albeit a great reminder of just how easy it can be to temporarily trade your desk for some drop bars and your career path for a gravel road.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://ridewithgps.com/embeds?type=route&#038;id=34763694&#038;sampleGraph=true\" style=\"width: 1px; min-width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>*Casual compared to our typical bike touring trips, which usually require ridiculous hike-a-bike situations on impassable Oregon forest roads, or brutal Southern Utah desert conditions with no water.
