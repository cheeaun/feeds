However, times have changed, and with phones now increasingly used for video consumption and gaming, larger devices have become the norm. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/06/Original-iPhone-Twitter.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-455649\" /><div class=\"center-wrap\"><em>The original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, circa 2007</em></div>\r\n<br/>\r\nYet whether because of its pocket convenience, conduciveness to little (and perhaps younger) hands, or its ability to be used singlehandedly, the continued lure of the smaller form factor device remains, and it's not a desire limited to Apple users, either. Since the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;, many people have been left wondering if another smartphone company might step up to the plate and offer an equivalent rival Android offering. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nEnter, Sony.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nSerial leaker Stever Hemmerstoffer (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1353385228014907393\">@Onleaks</a>) on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/this-is-the-new-xperia-compact-the-iphone-12-mini-rival-android-fans-need-1611507056-509494028\">revealed</a> newly leaked images of the company's upcoming Compact Xperia, a 5.5-inch device that's smaller than its 2017 predecessor, the popular but relatively short-lived 5.7-inch Xperia XZ1. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/5-5-inch-sony-xperia-onleaks.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-780070\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nMeasuring 140 x 68.9 x 8.9mm, it's slightly larger than the 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; (131.5 x 64.2 x 7.4mm), but whenever it launches, it will be the standout contender for the smallest Android phone on the market, given current similar rivals. \r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nConsider that the Pixel 5, which some see as Google's equivalent to the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;, comes in at a not-insignificant 6-inches (measuring 144.7 x 70.4 x 8mm), while the Galaxy S20 – the smallest in Samsung's latest lineup – is nearly an inch larger than Apple's device.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nReturning to Sony's yet-to-be-released 5.5-inch Xperia Compact successor, the phone has a flat display that's surrounded by thick bezels and a chin, while an 8-megapixel selfie camera lies within its water-drop shaped notch. On the rear is a dual-lens setup in a vertical array featuring a 13-megapixel main camera.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/5-5-inch-sony-xperiea-onleaks-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-780073\" />\r\n<br/>\r\nA fingerprint sensor is embedded in the power button – similar to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> on the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> – and a 3.5mm mini jack sits in the top of the phone for those who prefer wired headphones.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOther than that, not much else is known about the new Xperia Compact, suffice to say that it appears to be a direct response to Apple's decision to resurrect the small form factor phone. In which case, its relative success or failure in the Android market will be interesting to compare to the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/poor-iphone-12-mini-sales-supply-chain/\">apparently mixed fortunes</a> against Apple's other flagship 2021 offerings <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/production-shifting-from-iphone-12-mini-to-pro/\">thus far</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sony/\">Sony</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/sony-android-iphone-12-mini-rival-coming/\">Leaked Sony &#039;Xperia Compact&#039; Images Confirm Android-Based iPhone 12 Mini Rival on the Way</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/leaked-sony-xperia-compact-images-confirm-android-based-iphone-12-mini-rival-on-the-way.2281792/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ju6jCQI367E:ySdsR8l6KkY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ju6jCQI367E:ySdsR8l6KkY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Ju6jCQI367E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cdc7e5982b749bdbdf1c270820e8345b18cb9875d3a9aedde12f43fb076d20aa","category":"Apple"}
