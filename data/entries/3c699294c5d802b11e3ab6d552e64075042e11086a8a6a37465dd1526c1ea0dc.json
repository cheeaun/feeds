The racing is less predictable, the courses more dynamic and the actors actually have some character – are just some of the stand out reasons.</p>\n<p>This season will see the first women’s <a href=\"/tags/paris-roubaix\">Paris-Roubaix</a>, more multi-day events and, if things go well, an intriguing battle for Olympic glory in Tokyo, too.</p>\n<p>But if that’s not enough to convince you, how about that fact that the women’s peloton happens to be home to the very best cycling kits out there right now.</p>\n<p>Forget the homogeneous corporate cesspit of blues, reds and blacks that swamp the men’s WorldTour, the women’s peloton is a technicolour dreamland of psychedelic shapes and shades, like the Grand National on acid.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best bicycle mudguards for winter 2021: protect your bike </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/2079/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best cycling gloves for winter 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/7925/turbo-training-accessories-everything-you-need-for-training-indoors\">Turbo training accessories: Everything you need for training indoors</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nFor our ratings of the men's WorldTour team kits, <a href=\"/in-depth/2055/the-best-mens-worldtour-team-kits-for-2021\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>Below, we take a look at the nine women’s WorldTour team kits for the 2021 season and subject them to a completely arbitrary scoring system.</p>\n<h2>The women's WorldTour team kits, rated</h2>\n<h3>Ale BTC Ljubljana - 5/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42298\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/ale_btc_ljubljana-kit-2021.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>THIS. This is how all cycling kits should be. Yes. All cycling kits should look like pick 'n' mix. What’s your favourite pick 'n' mix sweet? Mine’s a fizzy cola bottle.</p>\n<h3>Canyon-Sram Racing - 4.5/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42305\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/canyon-sram-kit-2021.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Should we expect anything less from the hipster cycling fashion miracles at Rapha? The lightning bolts across the chest comfortably account for at least 36 more watts.</p>\n<h3>FDJ Nouvelle Aquitaine Futuroscope - 4/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42299\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/fdj_nouvelle-aquitane_futuroscope-kit-2021.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The little white flower in the Francaise des Jeux logo reminds me of summer holidays as a kid spent in rural France. Eating ham baguettes at a caravan site in the Loire Valley. Doing knee slides at the kid’s disco. Simpler times.</p>\n<h3>Liv Racing - 4.5/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42300\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/liv-racing-kit-2021.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I’m getting huge ‘Burton menswear 2010’ vibes from this t-shirt. Would be worn by a bloke called Aaron who would tell everyone how much his life was like the TV show Skins. Closest his life ever got to Skins was knowing a bloke called Tony.</p>\n<p>Not a good t-shirt, great cycling jersey though.</p>\n<h3>Movistar - 3/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42311\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/movistar-women-kit-2021.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Movistar needs to take notice from FDJ and Trek-Segafredo, have some kit originality, don’t copy your boring male counterparts.</p>\n<h3>SD Worx - 4/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42301\" class=\"file file-image file-image-png file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/team_sd_worx_kit-2021.png\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Did you know in Ancient Rome, purple was the colour of royalty? That’s because purple dye was extremely expensive. Why was it so expensive? Because purple dye was made from snails and it would take 9,000 to make just one gram of dye.</p>\n<p>Every day is a school day.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best bicycle mudguards for winter 2021: protect your bike </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/2079/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best cycling gloves for winter 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/7925/turbo-training-accessories-everything-you-need-for-training-indoors\">Turbo training accessories: Everything you need for training indoors</a></div>    </div></div><h3>Team BikeExchange - 1.5/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42302\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/team-bike-exchange-2021.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I’ve said it before, I will say it again. Why does this jersey look a corporate bank is making its staff take on a charity bike ride?</p>\n<h3>Team DSM -  3/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42303\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/team-dsm-kit-2021.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The more I look at this, the more indifferent it becomes. It’s just so <em>vanilla</em>.</p>\n<h3>Trek-Segafredo - 5/5</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42304\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-original\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/trek-segafredo-women-kit-2021.jpg\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>And just like that, <a href=\"/tags/trek-segafredo\">Trek-Segafredo</a> women's team remain undefeated in the battle for the best pro cycling kit. Classy, colourful, the sponsors look good, the white trim gives off a nautical vibe, it's all there. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/general-news\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"3c699294c5d802b11e3ab6d552e64075042e11086a8a6a37465dd1526c1ea0dc","category":"Cycling"}
