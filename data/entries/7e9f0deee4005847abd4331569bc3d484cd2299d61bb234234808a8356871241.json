Leonnig, and Paul Schwartzman, reporting for The Washington Post on how Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s refusal to allow their Secret Service detail to use any of the bathrooms in their home forced the agents to look elsewhere in the neighborhood:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The porta-potty was the agency’s initial solution to the\nprotective detail’s dilemma, but it was removed in the face of the\nneighborhood’s protests. After that, according to the law\nenforcement officials, the agents began using a bathroom in a\ngarage at the Obamas’ house, which the former president’s\nprotective detail had turned into a command post.</p>\n\n<p>The Obamas did not use the garage, so the extra traffic to and\nfrom the command post caused no problem. Yet this solution, too,\nwas short-lived after a Secret Service supervisor from the\nTrump/Kushner detail left an unpleasant mess in the Obama bathroom\nat some point before the fall of 2017, according to a person\nbriefed on the event. That prompted the leaders of the Obama\ndetail to ban the agents up the street from ever returning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, as they say, is a metaphor.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘The Event’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/16/the-event\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e9f0deee4005847abd4331569bc3d484cd2299d61bb234234808a8356871241","category":"Tech"}
