Motion is a Chrome extension that reduces sources of friction people experience using their browser to do work. Think of it sort of as a productivity tool for Chrome  power users. It’s not some sort of tool that makes you do <em>more</em> work by adding a “system” to manage, but rather a set of extensions to Chrome’s interface to make streamline and provide quicker access to the things you already do, all day every day.</p>\n\n<p>Among other features, Motion gives you instant access to your Google Calendar and Google Docs from any tab (instead of waiting for the entire web apps to load in new tabs, each time you want to use them); tab search and tab de-cluttering tools (like workspaces and vertical sub-tabs); and ways to block distracting sites in a non-intrusive way.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a Chrome power user, check it out. If “<em>like Superhuman, but for calendars</em>” sounds interesting to you, you should <em>definitely</em> check it out. Motion is just a Chrome extension — easy to try. They offer a 7-day free trial, and it’s just $15/month after that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Motion’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/10/motion\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a983b372088a4156747aa1fbf1acbf265cac4aa042dcc679fb8f62ef9bac9b12","category":"Tech"}
