Proportionally there are probably more coffee snobs in the cycling community than any other.</p>\n<p>Some may describe it as an unhealthy obsession, but there may now be proof that they are wrong.</p>\n<p>A study published in BMJ Open has found that drinking more daily cups of coffee is linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>The scientists from China Medical University analysed data from almost 1.1 million men across North America, Europe and Japan and concluded that for each extra daily cup of coffee the risk of prastate cancer reduced by nearly 1%.</p>\n<div id=\"file-42309\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/bmjopen-2021-february-11-2-f3.large_.jpg?itok=b1Vj3_z9\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>They concluded: 'This study suggests that increased coffee consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Further research is still warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms and active compounds in coffee.</p>\n<p>'If the association is further proved to be a causal effect, men might be encouraged to increase their coffee consumption to potentially decrease the risk of prostate cancer.'</p>\n<p>The study also found that those with the highest intake had a 9% reduction in risk compared to those with the lowest intake.</p>\n<p>What's more there was a 7% lower risk of localised prostate cancer, a 12% lower risk of advanced prostate cancer and a 16% lower risk of death from prostate cancer between the two extremities.</p>\n<p>Possible explanations for this, they explained are that: 'Coffee improves glucose metabolism, decreases concentrations of plasma insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and effects sex hormone levels, all of which may play roles in the initiation, development and progression of prostate cancer.'</p>\n<p>Several studies are cited that have shown how those factors help fight against and prevent prostate cancer.</p>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-see-related field-type-node-reference field-label-above\">      <div class=\"field-label\">See related&nbsp;</div>\n  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/3865/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Best bicycle mudguards for winter 2021: protect your bike </a></div>      <div class=\"field-item odd\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/2079/best-winter-gloves-for-cycling\">Best cycling gloves for winter 2021</a></div>      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/buying-guides/7925/turbo-training-accessories-everything-you-need-for-training-indoors\">Turbo training accessories: Everything you need for training indoors</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nSo make sure to pack in as many coffee stops as you can on your rides (<a href=\"/in-depth/8035/what-is-an-acceptable-distance-and-duration-to-ride-during-the-covid-19-crisis\">when that's possible again</a>), it'll give you a break, a boost for the next section and might help to prevent prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>A healthy obsession. </p>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-category-primary field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-hidden\">  \n  <div class=\"field-items\">      <div class=\"field-item even\"><a href=\"/cycling-nutrition\" typeof=\"skos:Concept\" property=\"rdfs:label skos:prefLabel\" datatype=\"\">Cycling nutrition</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Featured Articles","siteHash":"f129cda89106022134374fa071789f236ffc24ddd29b6bf4220b1143ee6f092f","entryHash":"b0a0d7a31d499d4ab5d202580c1013ce45b8ec21a03b11ea62ef7c91e6b5fd9e","category":"Cycling"}
