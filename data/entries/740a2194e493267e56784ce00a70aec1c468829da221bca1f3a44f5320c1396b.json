Normally, measuring blood glucose requires testing a drop of blood in a blood sugar meter or using an implanted continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The ability to observe any major increases or decreases in blood glucose may raise awareness of a potential health condition or simply help to improve a user's diet.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple is said to have secured patents around blood glucose monitoring, and the company is now purportedly \"focusing on securing reliability and stability prior to commercialization of the technology.\" The Apple-designed optical sensor is believed to be a skin-top continuous monitoring solution that does not require an implant.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nRumors suggest that Apple has been interested in adding blood glucose monitoring to the Apple Watch for some time. The company reportedly established a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/12/apple-secret-team-diabetes-research/\">team of biomedical engineers and consultants</a> specifically working on sensors for non-invasively monitoring blood sugar levels in 2017, and work on the sensor reportedly progressed to trials at clinical sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> has even been <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-spotted-testing-apple-watch-connected-glucose-monitor.2046254/\">spotted testing</a> what was believed to be a prototype glucose monitor connected to his Apple Watch.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nApple has added new health-oriented features to the Apple Watch in recent years, such as the ability to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/blood-oxygen-monitoring/\">measure blood oxygen levels</a> or take an ECG. Late last year, &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; teased the future of the Apple Watch, saying that the device is still \"in the early innings,\" with Apple testing \"mind blowing\" capabilities in its labs. \"Think about the amount of sensors in your car,\" said Cook, adding \"and arguably, your body is much more important than your car.\"\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/#future_apple_watch_rumors\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> is expected to arrive later this year, but there have been few rumors around what the new models may feature. While there have been reports of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/10/apple-watch-to-adopt-microled-3-4-years/\">microLED displays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/08/apple-watch-solid-state-haptic-buttons/\">solid-state buttons</a> with haptic feedback for the Apple Watch, these are not directly expected for the Apple Watch Series 7.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/\">etnews.com</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/apple-watch-series-7-blood-glucose-monitoring/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Rumored to Feature Blood Glucose Monitoring</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-rumored-to-feature-blood-glucose-monitoring.2281789/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UBNQKcjsX_s:xFNRILns7x4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UBNQKcjsX_s:xFNRILns7x4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UBNQKcjsX_s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"740a2194e493267e56784ce00a70aec1c468829da221bca1f3a44f5320c1396b","category":"Apple"}
