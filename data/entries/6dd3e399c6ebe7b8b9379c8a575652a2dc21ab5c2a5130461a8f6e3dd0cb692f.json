Call it collaborative evolution. From the early French <em>constructeurs</em> to the American pioneers, the old guard established a tradition of collaboration, which is and always has been an important element of the framebuilder’s process and creative growth, which in turn has influenced the growth of the cycling industry and culture at large.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204940\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>In that spirit of camaraderie, Adam Sklar and Hubert d’Autremont, two skilled professional framebuilders of the new school, joined forces in Tucson over the winter to have fun in a cooperative, non-commercial environment, to learn from each other, and to share information that would define their professional practice as well as refine their creative process.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204953\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>Both builders possess almost identical skill sets, but their works are idiosyncratic. Hubert tends to be more process-oriented, whereas Adam tends to be more production-oriented. Both Hubert and Adam design function-first, but Hubert’s designs tend toward traditional frame shapes and Adam skews toward sculptural, organic lines. In tandem, their goal: to create something unique together, unbound by the pressures of commerce or marketability, and to have a lot of fun along the way with a bunch of like-minded friends. Tucson at this time became home base for many sun chasers like Jonny Pucci, who painted each of the finished bikes in a unique desertic palette, as well as an ever-rotating cast of peers who came to cruise desert doubletrack in the vast Sonoran landscape, where the boundaries between work and play dissolved, mirage-like, completely.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204963\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Rangefinder-Madrean-Sklar-Pucci-mystic3.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>The intention of the RANGEFINDER collaboration was to share ideas, to find common ground, to turn solitary work into shared work, and to transform work into play. Play is essential to the process because the bicycle is an object designed for both function and fun, for purposeful conveyance as well as aimless exploring. If it’s not fun, why bother?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1413\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204980\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?resize=1024,723&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?resize=768,543&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?resize=1800,1272&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?resize=1335,943&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?resize=700,495&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/SKS08606.jpg?resize=1536,1085&amp;quality=75 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" /></p>\n<p>A rangefinder is a device used to measure the distance between an observer and a target. This collaborative project was named RANGEFINDER because it sounds cool, Adam and Hubert both dig analog photography, and a bicycle is a device used to find mountain ranges. But the word also connotes something interesting and unexpected: who is the observer and who is the target? The range being explored here is the creative ground in between two builders, a range of free-flowing ideas and cooperative mutual mind expansion that results in concrete handbuilt objects and inspires others to explore their own collaborative ranges. I hope that you are inspired by the work and play captured within these pages and that you take that inspiration to go out and find your own range. Have fun!</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>This book was made possible with generous support from <a href=\"https://www.taylorstitch.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taylor Stitch</a>, <a href=\"https://sim-works.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SimWorks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.whiteind.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">White Industries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paul Components</a>, <a href=\"http://sklarbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sklar Bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.madreanfabrication.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Madrean Fabrication</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ciclipucci.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cicli Pucci</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.danglesupply.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dangle Supply</a>. </em></p>\n<p><em>If you prefer a paper copy, you can also pick up a copy of this 108 page at <a href=\"https://www.mysticprojects.com/product/rangefinder-book\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mystic Projects</a>.</em></p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6dd3e399c6ebe7b8b9379c8a575652a2dc21ab5c2a5130461a8f6e3dd0cb692f","category":"Cycling"}
