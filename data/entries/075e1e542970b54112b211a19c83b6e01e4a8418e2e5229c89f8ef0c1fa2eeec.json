For large amounts of duplicates, the scanning process can be time-consuming and resource-demanding,\" says Oleksandr Kosovan, CEO of MacPaw. \"With the Duplicates Monitor, users will now be able to keep the duplicate files to a minimum, making their Macs faster and more organized and sparing disk space for things that really matter.\"</blockquote>The Duplicates Monitor is a free update for existing Gemini 2 users and will be available starting today. Gemini 2 is available on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gemini-2-the-duplicate-finder/id1090488118?mt=12\">Mac App Store</a> and the <a href=\"https://macpaw.com/gemini\">MacPaw website</a>, and is also available in <a href=\"https://setapp.com/\">Setapp</a>, the subscription-based service for macOS applications, which has plans starting at &#36;9.99 a month.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/gemini-2-duplicate-files-monitor-mac/\">Gemini 2 for Mac Gains Real-Time Duplicate Files Monitor With Alerts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gemini-2-for-mac-gains-real-time-duplicate-files-monitor-with-alerts.2281904/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NvpesQZr0gg:jKC45kHm0HA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=NvpesQZr0gg:jKC45kHm0HA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/NvpesQZr0gg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"075e1e542970b54112b211a19c83b6e01e4a8418e2e5229c89f8ef0c1fa2eeec","category":"Apple"}
