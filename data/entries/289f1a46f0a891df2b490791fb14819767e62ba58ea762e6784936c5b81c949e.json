Despite their status as elite endurance athletes, previous generations had a higher propensity for osteoporosis later in life, having never done the load-bearing work required to increase their bone density.</p>\n<p>‘People think strength training is all about building muscle to ride faster, but it’s also crucial for correcting imbalances and preventing injury,’ says coach Richard Lord from <a href=\"http://www.espressocyclecoaching.com\" target=\"_blank\">Espresso Cycle Coaching</a>.</p>\n<p>‘A total-body strength training programme will challenge your neuromuscular system and make you more economical on the bike. It will also help improve your handling skills, keep fatigue at bay, minimise aches and pains and boost recovery.’</p>\n<p>You don’t need to spend endless hours in the gym lifting heavy weights to see the benefits either. ‘Circuit training is a great way to incorporate strength sessions into your weekly routine,’ says Lord.</p>\n<p>‘You can easily perform an effective circuit-based workout at home, with minimal equipment, in 30 to 45 minutes. It’s especially practical during the winter when you’ll likely be spending more time indoors and less in the saddle.’</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dennismags.co.uk/cyclist\"><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/2021/01/clickable_subs_promo.jpg\" alt=\"click to subscribe\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>The tailor-made cycling circuits on the following pages provide everything you need to kick-start your strength training and hit the ground running in 2021.</p>\n<p>‘You’ll definitely notice the benefits in your riding,’ says Lord. ‘Just four weeks of quality strength training will make a big difference.’</p>\n<h2>Circuit 1</h2>\n<h3>Fire up your whole body</h3>\n<p>This circuit features a range of exercises that target all the major muscle groups and movement patterns required to correct imbalances, build bike-specific strength and reduce the risk of injury. What’s more, they can all be performed safely and easily at home with basic equipment – no gym membership required.</p>\n<p>‘Doing these six exercises back-to-back with minimal rest will help keep your heart rate elevated throughout the workout, improving your aerobic and anaerobic fitness and building endurance and explosive power,’ says Lord. ‘Once you’ve completed the reps for all six exercises, rest for 60-90 seconds then repeat for a total of 3-5 rounds.’</p>\n<p>If you’re new to strength training, start by performing this circuit twice weekly for 3-4 weeks, leaving at least a two-day gap between sessions. Once you’re comfortable with this, replace one of the sessions with our second circuit workout over the page.</p>\n<h3>1 - Bodyweight squat</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42393\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/cycling_strength_circuits_02_circuit_1_1_bodyweight_squat_1.jpg?itok=3FYJnw5P\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"file-42394\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/cycling_strength_circuits_03_circuit_1_1_bodyweight_squat_2.jpg?itok=c8krXa6-\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>A classic compound exercise that works all your major leg muscles and replicates the hip and knee extensions you perform when you’re pedalling.</p>\n<p>• Stand with your feet just wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing outwards slightly.</p>\n<p>• Keep your back upright and weight on your heels.</p>\n<p>• Squat down until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor.</p>\n<p>• Drive back up through your heels.</p>\n<p>Perform 15-20 reps</p>\n<p><strong>Expert tip:</strong> ‘To maintain a strong stance, imagine that you’re standing on a big piece of paper and trying to tear it apart with your feet,’ says Lord.</p>\n<h3>2 -

Always ensure that you leave at least a two-day gap between strength sessions to improve your recovery and reduce the risk of injury.</p>\n<h3>1 - Overhead squat</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42405\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/cycling_strength_circuits_14_circuit_2_1_overhead_squat_2.jpg?itok=Ul1wh2Fm\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"file-42404\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/cycling_strength_circuits_13_circuit_2_1_overhead_squat_1.jpg?itok=ZOejS1Gc\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>A variation of the basic squat that forces you to stabilise your upper back throughout the movement, helping to improve your form.</p>\n<p>• Hold a towel or a broom handle with a wide grip with elbows locked just behind your head, keeping your biceps in line with your ears.</p>\n<p>• Stand with your feet just wider than shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing outwards slightly.</p>\n<p>• Keeping your back upright and weight on your heels, squat down until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor.</p>\n<p>• Drive back up through your heels.</p>\n<p>Perform 15-20 reps</p>\n<p><strong>Expert tip:</strong> ‘Ask a friend or family member to film you doing this exercise side-on so you can check your back is straight,’ says Lord.</p>\n<h3>2 - Renegade row</h3>\n<div id=\"file-42406\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/cycling_strength_circuits_15_circuit_2_2_renegade_row_1.jpg?itok=z41k4aZr\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"file-42407\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg file-content-full-width\">\n<div class=\"content\">    <img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/01/cycling_strength_circuits_16_circuit_2_2_renegade_row_2.jpg?itok=Zb-iR2nq\" alt=\"\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This exercise improves strength in your back and core to ensure you can maintain a stable and aggressive position on the bike for longer.</p>\n<p>• Start in a press-up position holding the handles of a pair of light dumbbells (hexagonal dumbbells will help with stability).</p>\n<p>• Row one dumbbell upwards, pulling it towards you so that your thumb touches your armpit, then lower it back to the start.</p>\n<p>• Repeat on the other side, aiming to stay parallel to the floor throughout rather than twisting your torso.</p>\n<p>Perform 10-16 reps with each arm, alternating sides</p>\n<p><strong>Expert tip:</strong> No dumbbells?
