I fact checked every word\nuttered by this President from his inauguration day in January\n2017 until September 2020 — when the daily number of lies got so\nunmanageably high that I had to start taking a pass on some of his\nremarks to preserve my health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I were asked to sum up the entire Trump era in one word, the word I’d choose is <em>lies</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Lies, lies, lies. Liars telling lies. One very talented liar telling lies that many others parroted. Lies. Lies are poison. We’re not hooked up to assume that when one side says A, and the other side says B, that one side (or both) might be lying. We’re hooked up to assume both sides are arguing in good faith, for what they perceive to be the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Also: Daniel Dale gets a 3-month vacation, right?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘The Most Notable Lies of Donald Trump’s Presidency’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/19/trump-lies\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"faebed7881f0a0475d97cef0b28a0b5016d1fa2c53808146b49883e92a1fe3f8","category":"Tech"}
