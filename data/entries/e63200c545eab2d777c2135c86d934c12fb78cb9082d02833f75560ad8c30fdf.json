The warning also claims the iPhone 12 is not specifically more dangerous than other models.</p>\n<p>Several weeks back, Heart Rhythm Journal published <a href=\"https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(20)31227-3/fulltext\">results</a> of a test wherein it repeatedly found that moving an iPhone 12 with MagSafe close to a patient's ICD interfered with the functioning of that lifesaving device. After that report, tech enthusiasts visited forums, Twitter, and Reddit to spread speculation that the iPhone 12 was particularly dangerous to people with pacemakers because of the introduction of MagSafe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1737331#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1737331&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e63200c545eab2d777c2135c86d934c12fb78cb9082d02833f75560ad8c30fdf","category":"Tech"}
