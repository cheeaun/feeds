That’s according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> on Friday by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who says that Apple plans to release the redesigned MacBook Air later this year or in 2022.</p><p>Apple will shrink the laptop by making the bezel smaller, though the screen will still be 13 inches. The current MacBook Air has a width of about 12 inches and a depth of 8.36 inches. When closed, the height of the current model tapers, measuring 0.16 inches at its shortest point, and 0.63 inches at its tallest. Presumably, shrinking the bezel will make the width and depth smaller, though Gurman doesn’t state if the new MacBook Air will still have the tapered height.</p><p class=\"jumpTag\"><a href=\"/article/3604609/the-next-macbook-air-could-get-even-lighter-and-thinner-and-bring-back-magsafe.html#jump\">To read this article in full, please click here</a></p></section></article>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6e7b012133009eabd4f0f478ac90c7deaa407759976441c29ce0002556a0ab7c","category":"Apple"}
