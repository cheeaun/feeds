It is a sprawling, serious, and complex argument, but the essay wastes not a word. Each sentence builds upon the last; each paragraph furthers the argument toward its inexorable conclusion:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>America will not survive the big lie just because a liar is\nseparated from power. It will need a thoughtful repluralization of\nmedia and a commitment to facts as a public good. The racism\nstructured into every aspect of the coup attempt is a call to heed\nour own history. Serious attention to the past helps us to see\nrisks but also suggests future possibility. We cannot be a\ndemocratic republic if we tell lies about race, big or small.\nDemocracy is not about minimizing the vote nor ignoring it,\nneither a matter of gaming nor of breaking a system, but of\naccepting the equality of others, heeding their voices and\ncounting their votes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I implore you not merely to read it, but to study it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘‘The American Abyss’’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/12/the-american-abyss\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"91ec54a34d2e6dd848be1254136880974446577320b1ad9f0e50dc3ddb356264","category":"Tech"}
