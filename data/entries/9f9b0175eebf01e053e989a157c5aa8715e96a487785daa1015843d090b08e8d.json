The ride quality of titanium is second to none. It&#8217;ll outlive carbon and won&#8217;t rust out like steel, plus it magically smooths out bumpy roads. Perfect for a bike like the Cosmic Stallion! This beautiful ti tubing is a new thing for All-City so they had to develop their own tubing, dubbed Oberon Titanium Tubing. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1530\" height=\"1020\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.50.38-PM.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-204848\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.50.38-PM.png?w=1530&amp;quality=75 1530w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.50.38-PM.png?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.50.38-PM.png?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.50.38-PM.png?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-21-at-5.50.38-PM.png?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1530px) 100vw, 1530px\" /></p>\n<p>This frame also comes with the All-City Signature Details you&#8217;ve come to love with custom dropouts, reinforced bottle bosses, custom-designed Shot Collar.
