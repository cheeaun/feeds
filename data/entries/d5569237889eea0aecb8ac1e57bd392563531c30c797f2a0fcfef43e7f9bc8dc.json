Upday appears to be a <a href=\"https://www.axelspringer.com/en/brands/upday-3\">joint collaboration</a> between German publisher Axel Springer and Samsung, which also <a href=\"http://upday.com/\">runs a news service</a> on its phones powered by it.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nIt is not clear what the financial terms of the deal is between Facebook and Upday, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/01/facebook-to-pay-uk-media-millions-to-licence-news-stories\">reportedly</a>, the licensing deals Facebook is cutting with publishers to place their content in News collectively run into the tens of millions of pounds, with the biggest publishers making millions a year from the the agreements. While those figures might pale to what Facebook makes in ad revenues globally — that reaches into the tens of billions of dollars quarterly — they represent significant sums for the beleaguered U.K. media industry.</blockquote>Like the U.S. version, Facebook News works by combining editorially curated stories and articles based on what users read, share, and follow on the social network. Users will also get controls that allow them to hide topics or publishers from their feed, according to Facebook.\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nThe company says it is currently negotiating with partners to launch the feature in France and Germany, with Brazil and India also in its sights. <div class=\"linkback\">Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/facebook-news-tab-launches-in-the-united-kingdom/\">Facebook News Tab Launches in the United Kingdom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-news-tab-launches-in-the-united-kingdom.2281895/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/><div class=\"feedflare\">\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C0-GnjvanpI:B4-kNAWShWA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=C0-GnjvanpI:B4-kNAWShWA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/C0-GnjvanpI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d5569237889eea0aecb8ac1e57bd392563531c30c797f2a0fcfef43e7f9bc8dc","category":"Apple"}
