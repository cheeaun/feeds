The new system, set to go live on 27 January, will now pre-generate and update automatically, and allow users to control what activities are included on their heatmap.</p>\n<p>At a zoomed-out view, the personal heatmap shows areas where your recorded activities are clustered. As you zoom in, you get a view that’s more akin to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-updates-heatmap-with-a-claimed-200000-years-worth-of-data/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Strava’s overall heatmap</a>, which shows a colour-graded view of the routes where you recorded the most activities – Orange heat represents your hottest/most ridden routes while Gray heat at the bottom of the scale your least popular routes.</p>\n<p>The new update means you can now show running and cycling alongside other activities (of which there are 33 to choose from, including stand-up paddle-boarding, ice skating and velomobile riding) on the same map – ideal for the cyclist that likes to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-training/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">incorporate cross-training into their workouts</a>.</p>\n<p>The previous incarnation of the system had to be generated and refreshed manually, and was limited to running or cycling activities only.</p>\n<p>The new personal heatmap will also allow users to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose the time period that it covers – you can either look at an all-time view or just a specified year</li>\n<li>Choose the colour of the map trace</li>\n<li>Choose the style of map, including a standard map or satellite view</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The personal heatmap is a subscriber-only feature that’s available on Strava’s website.</p>\n<p>With all of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/covid-19-cycling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the obvious reasons</a> that curtailed the geographical limits of our riding in 2020, let’s hope we can expand our horizons and, thus, our Strava personal heatmaps, in 2021.</p>\n</body>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c9202ec249c8e91a349b5f827e1ece15817333317e12c762fcb51001540f68ab","category":"Cycling"}
